+  <description summary="Protocol for composing text">
+    This protocol allows compositors to act as input methods and to send text
+    to applications. A text input object is used to manage state of what are
+    typically text entry fields in the application.
+
+    This document adheres to the RFC 2119 when using words like "must",
+    "should", "may", etc.
+
+    Warning! The protocol described in this file is experimental and
+    backward incompatible changes may be made. Backward compatible changes
+    may be added together with the corresponding interface version bump.
+    Backward incompatible changes are done by bumping the version number in
+    the protocol and interface names and resetting the interface version.
+    Once the protocol is to be declared stable, the 'z' prefix and the
+    version number in the protocol and interface names are removed and the
+    interface version number is reset.

+    <description summary="text input">
+      The zwp_text_input_v3 interface represents text input and input methods
+      associated with a seat. It provides enter/leave events to follow the
+      text input focus for a seat.
+
+      Requests are used to enable/disable the text-input object and set
+      state information like surrounding and selected text or the content type.
+      The information about the entered text is sent to the text-input object
+      via the preedit_string and commit_string events.
+
+      Text is valid UTF-8 encoded, indices and lengths are in bytes. Indices
+      must not point to middle bytes inside a code point: they must either
+      point to the first byte of a code point or to the end of the buffer.
+      Lengths must be measured between two valid indices.
+
+      Focus moving throughout surfaces will result in the emission of
+      zwp_text_input_v3.enter and zwp_text_input_v3.leave events. The focused
+      surface must commit zwp_text_input_v3.enable and
+      zwp_text_input_v3.disable requests as the keyboard focus moves across
+      editable and non-editable elements of the UI. Those two requests are not
+      expected to be paired with each other, the compositor must be able to
+      handle consecutive series of the same request.
+
+      State is sent by the state requests (set_surrounding_text,
+      set_content_type and set_cursor_rectangle) and a commit request. After an
+      enter event or disable request all state information is invalidated and
+      needs to be resent by the client.

+        zwp_text_input_v3.disable when there is no longer any input focus on
+        the current surface.
+
+        Clients must not enable more than one text input on the single seat
+        and should disable the current text input before enabling the new one.
+        At most one instance of text input may be in enabled state per instance,
+        Requests to enable the another text input when some text input is active
+        must be ignored by compositor.

+        preedit_string, commit_string, and delete_surrounding_text events.
+
+        The set_surrounding_text, set_content_type and set_cursor_rectangle
+        requests must follow if the text input supports the necessary
+        functionality.
+
+        State set with this request is double-buffered. It will get applied on
+        the next zwp_text_input_v3.commit request, and stay valid until the
